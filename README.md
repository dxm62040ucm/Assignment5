1) Implemented the Naive Bayes method using the scikit-learn library, using the glass dataset,
   splitting it into training and testing parts with train_test_split,
   and evaluating the model using score and classification_report
2) Implemented linear SVM method using scikit library, used glass dataset
   Use train_test_split to create training and testing part
   Evaluate the model on test part using score and
   classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
   Finally showcased the comparision between Naive Bayes Method and Linear SVM Method Classification Reports.
